##### To utilize the best of UPcmd, you always want to access the data conviently

Let's talk about how we can prepare the data object


### Demo








[source](https://github.com/upcmd/up/blob/master/tests/functests/c0156.yml)

##### Main task yaml file
```
    vars:
      school: |
        sg:
          name: sydney grammar
          state: nsw
          address: sydney
          postcode: 2000
    tasks:
    - name: task
      task:
      - func: cmd
        desc: |
          1st solution: register object in any template rending
        do:
        - name: print
          desc: |
            Use a actual cmd to register a variable does not make sense, but it is doable.
            It is not advised to do it this way
          cmd: '{{.school |reg "myschool"}}'
        - name: print
          desc: |
            please note that myschool is only a string, but not an object
          cmd: '{{.myschool}}'
        - name: print
          desc: |
            please note that below result is only a string representation of the object
            any golang template result can only be string, but not a object
          cmd: '{{.myschool | ymlToObj |objToYml}}'
        - name: print
          desc: |
            now register the object to a named var myschool_object
          cmd: '{{.myschool | ymlToObj |reg "myschool_object"}}'
        - name: print
          desc: |
            same as above, this will only print the string reprentation of the object
          cmd: '{{.myschool_object}}'
        - name: printObj
          desc: |
            same as above, this will only print the string reprentation of the object
          cmd: '{{.myschool_object}}'
        - name: printObj
          desc: |
            * IMPORTANT
            use the object var name to refer to the object in register
          cmd: myschool_object
      - func: cmd
        desc: |
          2nd solution:
          use dvar auto coversion
        dvars:
        - name: myschool2
          value: '{{.school }}'
          flags:
          - toObj
          - v
        do:
        - name: print
          cmd: |
            {{.myschool2}}
            {{.myschool2_object}}
        - name: printObj
          cmd: myschool2_object
      - func: cmd
        desc: |
          3rd solution:
          use toObj cmd
          details: https://upcmd.netlify.app/cmd-func/c0095/
        do:
        - name: toObj
          cmd:
            fromkey: school
            reg: myschool3_object
        - name: printObj
          cmd: myschool3_object
    
```

### Where are the data object from?


The data objects come from a few sources:

1. scopes: you can define vars and dvars in scope group
2. global vars/dvars
3. vars/dvars in func
4. vars registered from with templating using reg template func
5. vars registered using reg cmd
6. dvar flag: toObj will also register the object to that local exec vars context

This examples shows you the point 4,5 and 6, three ways to set the vars

You can make use of vars in following cases:
1. if condition
2. any templating rendering
3. yml operation using cmd: query, ymlWrite, ymlDelete
