##### Demo a little more complex case with object merging in scope and externalizing settings to file


### d0030_school.yml reference






```
    address:
      suburb:
        name: {{.student.address.suburb.name}}
        postcode: 2000
        CBD: yes
      school: {{.student.address.school}}
    
```






### Test result


prod is not within the instance(dev)'s group, so it is correct
that school_prod is can not be rendered a value











### Demo
