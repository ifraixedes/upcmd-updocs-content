##### Sometime you may need to do some adhoc message transformation in an elegant way, you would like to implementate your internal code or logic based on a interface / contract rather than external direct mapping. In such a scenario, it is better we could use a mapping layer to sheld your code suffering the impact of external change. We can use datatemplate for this purpose. In datatemplate definition, you map your own data structure/object with external vars/objects, then in your rendered value, you use the reference to your own object/key/value etc to generate the value required for your own business
