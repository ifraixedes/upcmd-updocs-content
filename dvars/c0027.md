##### A dvar value is normally a string, which could be a formated yml content, then be converted to an object. This demo shows that you can use a flag: to_object to notate this dvar will be transformed to an object and registered to global runtime


### Rules


* you can reference to plain dvar with the string|untemplated value
* you can reference to hiera structure of a object once it is converted
* the new name of the dvar object will be: dvar_object
