##### A dvar value is normally a string, which could be a formated yml content, then be converted to an object. This demo shows that you can use a flag: toObj to notate this dvar will be transformed to an object and registered to global runtime


### Rules


* you can reference to plain dvar with the string|untemplated value
* you can reference to hiera structure of a object once it is converted
* the new name of the dvar object will be: dvar_object
* the flag keepName makes the dvar keep its original name as is instead of creating dvar_object
* keepName only used and pair to toObj

##### Main task yaml file
```
    vars:
      student:
        name: Tom
        gender: Male
        address:
          suburb:
            name: sydney
            postcode: 2000
            CBD: yes
          school: Sydney Grammar
    dvars:
    - name: a_smart_guy
      value: |
        name: Tom
        gender: Male
        school: Sydney Grammar
      flags: [toObj]
    - name: school_address
      #    expand: 2
    
      desc: |
        it can reference to the dvar object a_smart_guy_object has been registered from last step
      value: |
        address:
          suburb:
            name: {{.student.address.suburb.name}}
            postcode: 2000
            CBD: yes
          school: {{.student.address.school}}
          tom:
            name: {{.a_smart_guy_object.name}}
      flags: [toObj]
    - name: tom
      desc: |
        in this case, we use keepName flag to make the dvar name the same name we give. So instead we have regitered tom (yml string) and tom_object (object), we now only have tom as registered object
      value: |
        name: {{.a_smart_guy_object.name}}
        gender: Male
        school: Sydney Grammar
      flags:
      - toObj
      - keepName
    tasks:
    - name: task
      task:
      - func: shell
        do:
        - echo """a smart guy=>{{.a_smart_guy}}"""
        - echo """postcode=>{{.student.address.suburb.postcode}}"""
        - echo """school address {{.school_address}}"""
        - echo """this guy is in =>{{.a_smart_guy_object.school}} school"""
        - echo """school address object {{.school_address_object.suburb.name}}"""
        - echo """school address object -> {{.school_address_object.address.suburb.name}}"""
