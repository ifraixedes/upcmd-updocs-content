     WARN: [Rescued in task level, but not advised!] - [setting rescue to yes/true to continue is not recommended
    it is advised to locate root cause of the problem, fix it and re-run the task again
    it is the best practice to test the execution in your ci pipeline to eliminate problems rather than dynamically fix using rescue]
