##### The vars definition block in a func(shell in this case) make the vars' scope to be local scope to the func, the var defined in the local scope is only available in all the execution steps in that func

It is similar to func or method in most of programming languages, the vars defined in local scope in func are only avaiable in local scope   callee task is reprented using a var name make it dynamic in execution time


### Glabal vars


The global vasrs are the one defined externally to the tasks definition, eg:
```
vars:
  a: runtime-a
  e: runtime-e
  k: runtime-k
  studentname: Jason
```











### Local vars


The local vasrs are the one defined within the func definition, eg:
```
vars:
  studentname: Tom
  school: SG
```











### Auto merge


During the runtime of step1, it will merge the vars with the same name, the local vars take priority. In this demo, the var studentname will be Tom instead of Jason

##### Main task yaml file
```
    vars:
      a: runtime-a
      e: runtime-e
      k: runtime-k
      studentname: Jason
    tasks:
    - name: task
      task:
      - func: shell
        name: step1
        desc: to test display env vars from shell context
        vars:
          studentname: Tom
          school: SG
        do:
        - echo "hello, world"
        - echo "hello {{.studentname}}"
    
```
##### Main log file
```

##### Raw logs with different verbose level

### What to observe in log file


do check the verbosed log in vvv level, you will see that studentname exist only in local var scope, which are the final exec vars
```
-------runtime global final merged with dvars-------

{
  "k": "runtime-k",
  "studentname": "Jason",
  "a": "runtime-a",
  "e": "runtime-e"
}

overall final exec vars:

{
  "a": "runtime-a",
  "e": "runtime-e",
  "school": "SG",
  "k": "runtime-k",
  "studentname": "Tom"
}

```
