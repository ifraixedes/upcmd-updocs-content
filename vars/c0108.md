##### So far, we have scoped vars and eventually they will be living in global runtime or local scope in a func, when you need to access the var across funcs, then you will have to define it in global runtime vars, or grouped vars scope, or register a var to glbale runtime. In this demo, we show that you can use taskscope flag to mark a dvar to be in task scope, so that you can easily access this task scope var accross different funcs


### Demo

##### Main task yaml file
```
    vars:
      tom: this is tom
    tasks:
    - name: task
      task:
      - func: cmd
        vars:
          jerry: this is jerry
        do:
        - name: print
          cmd: '{{.tom}}'
        - name: print
          cmd: '{{.jerry}}'
      - func: cmd
        do:
        - name: print
          desc: jerry is in local scope so there is no value
          cmd: '{{.jerry}}'
      - func: cmd
        dvars:
        - name: jerry
          value: this is jerry in task scope
          flags:
          - taskscope
        do:
        - name: print
          desc: this should print out the dvar value of jerry
          cmd: '{{.jerry}}'
      - func: cmd
        do:
        - name: print
          desc: this should print out the dvar value of jerry as it is declared jerry
            is in taskscope
          cmd: '{{.jerry}}'
      - func: cmd
        vars:
          jerry: jerry is overrided in local scope
        do:
        - name: print
          desc: var jerry in task scope is overrided by local var jerry
          cmd: '{{.jerry}}'
      - func: cmd
        do:
        - name: print
          desc: this should print out the jerry defined in task var scope
          cmd: '{{.jerry}}'
