##### Showcase the var scope, how local var and global var are diffent and used in different context


### Demo

##### Main task yaml file
```
    vars:
      tom: this is tom
    tasks:
    - name: task
      task:
      - func: call
        do: sub1
      - func: cmd
        desc: |
          check if hitom is available in global context
          it should be <no value> as hitom in sub1 is marked localOnly
        do:
        - name: print
          cmd: '{{.hitom}}'
      - func: call
        do: sub2
      - func: cmd
        desc: |
          check if hitom is available in global context
          though hitom was regiser as global var, but it was registered to its own call stack
          however this is only available in its own call stack global but not return and available to its parent var scope
        do:
        - name: print
          cmd: '{{.hitom}}'
    - name: sub1
      task:
      - func: cmd
        do:
        - name: reg
          cmd:
            name: hitom
            desc: by default hitom is registered in to global context
            value: 'hello, {{.tom}}'
          flags: [localOnly]
        - name: print
          cmd: '{{.hitom}}'
      - func: cmd
        do:
        - name: print
          desc: should be <no value> since it is marked localOnly
          cmd: '{{.hitom}}'
    - name: sub2
      task:
      - func: cmd
        do:
        - name: reg
          cmd:
            name: hitom
            desc: by default hitom is registered in to global context
            value: 'hello, {{.tom}}'
        - name: print
          cmd: '{{.hitom}}'
      - func: cmd
        do:
        - name: print
          desc: |
            by default hitom is accessible from global context, that's why it is accessiable cross func
            however this is only available in its own call stack global but not return and available to its parent var scope
          cmd: '{{.hitom}}'

### vars accessibility in call stack


Understanding of global vars scope in call stack

global vars scope is not unique, it is a concept of relative scope for its call stack. within that call stack, all changes(new registered global vars) will be valid only for its own stack in that call func only
