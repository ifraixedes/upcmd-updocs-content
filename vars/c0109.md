### Demo

##### Main task yaml file
```
    vars:
      tom: this is tom
    tasks:
    - name: task
      task:
      - func: cmd
        dvars:
        - name: jerry
          value: this is jerry in task scope
          flags:
          - taskscope
        do:
        - name: print
          desc: this should print out the dvar value of jerry
          cmd: '{{.jerry}}'
      - func: call
        do:
        - subtask1
    - name: subtask1
      task:
      - func: cmd
        do:
        - name: print
          desc: this should print out the dvar value of jerry as it is declared jerry
            is in taskscope
          cmd: '{{.jerry}}'
        - name: trace
          cmd: ===>
      - func: cmd
        vars:
          jerry: jerry is overriden in local scope
        do:
        - name: print
          desc: |
            remember that the caller's vars should override callee's vars
            so jerry's value should the one from caller instead this local value
          cmd: '{{.jerry}}'
        - name: trace
          cmd: <===
        - name: trace
          cmd: '--->'
      - func: cmd
        do:
        - name: print
          desc: this should print out the jerry defined in caller's task var scope
          cmd: '{{.jerry}}'
