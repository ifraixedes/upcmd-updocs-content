##### Showcases the compex sub task with finally block without ignoreError flag


### Demo








[source](https://github.com/upcmd/up/blob/master/tests/functests/f0186.yml)

##### Main task yaml file
```
    tasks:
    - name: task
      task:
      - func: block
        loop:
        - item1
        - item2
        desc: task
        do:
        - func: call
          do: sub_task_layer1
    - name: sub_task_layer1
      desc: sub_task_layer1
      task:
      - func: cmd
        do:
        - name: print
          cmd: "in sub_task_layer1"
      - func: call
        loop:
        - aaa
        - bbb
        do:
        - sub_task_layer2
    - name: sub_task_layer2
      task:
      - func: shell
        name: step1
        desc: step 1
        do:
        - 'echo """opening file: {{.loopitem}}"""'
        - echo "hello"|grep "world"
      - func: cmd
        name: step2
        desc: |
          in this case, since there is no ignoreError, the exception was captured by task level finaly code block
          opened file is safely closed
          to make the flow to continue to reach step2, use ignoreError
        do:
        - name: print
          cmd: step 2
      desc: |
        without rescue, the execution will return a non-zero  return code in shell and also report the error
        with rescue, the program will return 0
      rescue: true
      finally:
      - func: shell
        name: close_file
        desc: |
          ensure the opened file is closed
        do:
        - echo "close the file ....."

### What's the difference betwee the step level and task level finally cleanup and rescue?


The only difference would be that in the step level, you would be able to obtain the exec result and then conditionally do something about it
