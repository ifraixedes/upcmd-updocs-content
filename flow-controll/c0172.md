##### Introduce to use finally/rescue in task step for a guranteed cleanup when task step has got panic


### Demo








[source](https://github.com/upcmd/up/blob/master/tests/functests/c0172.yml)

##### Main task yaml file
```
    tasks:
    - name: task
      task:
      - func: cmd
        desc: step 1
        do:
        - name: print
          cmd: step 1
        - name: panic
        - name: print
          cmd: extra step ......... it will never reach here
        rescue: true
        finally: close_file
      - func: cmd
        desc: step 2
        do:
        - name: print
          cmd: step 2
    - name: close_file
      task:
      - func: shell
        name: close_file
        desc: |
          ensure the opened file is closed
        do:
        - echo "close the file ....."
    
```

### what will happen if there is no rescue for the task without rescue


This showcases that the finally step invokes the close_file task to ensure the opened file is closed

The task will fail if there is no rescue to be "true", in this case, user choose to fail the task, or if rescue is set, then the execution will continue to the next func step call
