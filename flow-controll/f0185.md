##### Showcases that you can can do finally cleanup and resuce the panic in the sub task level


### Demo








[source](https://github.com/upcmd/up/blob/master/tests/functests/f0185.yml)

##### Main task yaml file
```
    tasks:
    - name: task
      task:
      - func: call
        desc: task
        do:
        - sub_task_layer1
    - name: sub_task_layer1
      desc: sub_task_layer1
      task:
      - func: call
        loop:
        - item1
        - item2
        do:
        - sub_task_layer2
    - name: sub_task_layer2
      task:
      - func: shell
        name: step1
        desc: step 1
        do:
        - 'echo """opening file: {{.loopitem}}"""'
        - echo "hello"|grep "world"
      - func: cmd
        name: step2
        desc: |
          in this case, since there is no ignoreError, the exception was captured by task level finaly code block
          opened file is safely closed
          to make the flow to continue to reach step2, use ignoreError
        do:
        - name: print
          cmd: step 2
      desc: |
        without rescue, the execution will return a non-zero  return code in shell and also report the error
        with rescue, the program will return 0
      rescue: true
      finally:
      - func: shell
        name: close_file
        desc: |
          ensure the opened file is closed
        do:
        - echo "close the file ....."
    
```
