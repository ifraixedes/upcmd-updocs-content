##### It is a implicit rule that it is a public task if the task name start with a upper case letter, otherwise it is a protected task

The intention is that public tasks is a callerable one from CLI command, which could have a chaine of depenent protected tasks for detailed implementations

Also, for collaboration of different projects, it is a implicit rule that public task is more like a interface to be consumable and protected tasks are internal private business.

There is no hard rule to forbid you to use protected tasks, it is just a mutual common contract to collaborate with each other in a clear standard


### How to run


```
up list  -d ./tests/functests -t c0140.yml -i dev --configdir=./tests/functests
loading [Config]:  ./tests/functests/upconfig
loading [Task]:  ./tests/functests/c0140.yml
instance id: dev
-task list
 1  |     Main: |   public| main entry
 2  |    Build: |   public| A build task
 3  | internal: |protected| a internal process needed by Build
-
```

##### Main task yaml file
```
    tasks:
    - name: task
      desc: main entry
      task:
      - func: cmd
        do:
        - name: print
          cmd: 'I am the main entry'
    - name: Build
      desc: A build task
      task:
      - func: cmd
        do:
        - name: print
          cmd: 'I am the build task'
      - func: call
        do:
        - internal
    - name: internal
      desc: a internal process needed by Build
      task:
      - func: cmd
        do:
        - name: print
          cmd: 'I am a internal task'
    
```
##### Main log file
```
    loading [Config]:  ./tests/functests/upconfig.yml
    Main config:

     MaxModuelCallLayers -> 256
    work dir: /up_project/up
    -exec task: task
    loading [Task]:  ./tests/functests/c0140
    module: [self], instance id: [dev], exec profile: []
    profile -  envVars:
    
    (*core.Cache)({
    })
    
    Task1: [task ==> task: main entry ]
    -Step1:
    self: final context exec vars:

    })
    
    ~SubStep1: [print:  ]
    I am the main entry
