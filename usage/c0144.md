##### By default, you will be using current working directory for an execution of your task

Sometimes, we need a protected way or simly we need a jailed execution to where the task up.yml is located, in this case, we could config the working directory to be the refdir and in this case the refdir is out side of current directory


### How it works


By default, the WorkDir setting is "cwd", which is the current working directory you execute the up command

There are two ways doing it:

* You can configure it in the upconfig.yml
```
version: 1.0.0
Verbose: v
MaxCallLayers: 8
RefDir: .
WorkDir: refdir      -> use "refdir" to dictate the execution working directory will be in the refdir instead of current work dir
TaskFile: up.yml
ConfigDir: .
ConfigFile: upconfig.yml
```

* You can use cmd arg in CLI to specify that you want it to be refdir

```
  -w, --workdir=WORKDIR        working directory: cwd | refdir

  eg:
  up ngo task -d ./tests/functests -t wip.yml -i dev --configdir=./tests/functests -w refdir
```











### Application using current directory as work directory


Normally, if you intend to do project based work, then you will need to use the default setting: cwd - current work directory as the working directory.

In this case, you cd to the project directory, all the directories in your up.yml will be reletive path to your project directory











### Application using refdir


If the up.yml tasks are wrapped as a service to do something system wide and not relevent to your specific project, all the changes made in the task are confined within the refdir, than the WorkDir should be refdir

For example, you could use below alias: install_apps to install and update all your softwares, this task will manage to install all defined softwares and if it requires to caches some files and temp directories, it will put them into the refdir

```
alias install_apps='up ngo task -d /myapps/install_all_required_softwards -w refdir'
```

So, when you consider publish your own task(s) for other people to use as a standalone tool/cli cmd, you should use this setting
