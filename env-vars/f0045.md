##### This showcases:
  * Fail fast if a env var is not in the current shell session

It is always better to provide this type of validation so that it fail fast to ensure all the initial required data are gathered.


### Demo








[source](https://github.com/upcmd/up/blob/master/tests/functests/f0045.yml)

##### Main task yaml file
```
    scopes:
    - name: global
      dvars:
      - name: student_name
        desc: show that if required ENV var is empty and it will fail if this is empty
        value: '{{ env "STUDENT_NAME" |validateMandatoryFailIfNone "student_name" }}'
    #same as below:
    #        value: '{{ expandenv "$STUDENT_NAME" |validateMandatoryFailIfNone "student_name" }}'
    
    tasks:
    - name: task
    
```
##### Main log file
```
