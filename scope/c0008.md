##### Scope is concept of named context encapsulation. For example, for a software development, you will probably have development env, namely dev; system test env, namely st; staging env etc, all group to a non-prod group. Then prod env and disaster recovery env, grouped into prod group

Also you could have a global defined scope for common vars for all groups to inherit their vars to be the default from if not defined in that scope

So put it in simple example, if you have nonprod and prod group defined, then your runtime instance id (eg dev) belonging to a nonprod id will automatically inherit all vars definition from top to down, from vars defintion in global group, to nonprod group, then dev, then global runtime, during func execution runtime, they will merge with the local vars


### How to run


run shell command:  up ngo task -d ./tests/functests -t c0008.yml -i dev -v vvv --configdir=./tests/functests











### Instance id


An execution of UP cli cmd can take an instance id for execution, in this demo, it is dev as example, if you do not use any instance id, by default, your execution will inherit from global group, then global runtime, then local vars

##### Main task yaml file
```
    scopes:
    - name: global
      vars:
        a: global-a
        b: global-b
        c: global-c
        d: global-d
    - name: prod
      members: [dr, prod]
      vars:
        a: prod-a
        c: prod-c
    - name: nonprod
      members:
      - dev
      - st
      - staging
      vars:
        a: non-prod-a
        b: non-prod-b
        c: non-prod-c
    - name: staging
      vars:
        a: staging-a
        b: staging-b
    - name: dev
      vars:
        a: dev-a
        c: dev-c
    tasks:
    - name: task
      task:
      - func: shell
        do:
        - echo "test out the var scopes only"
    
```

##### Logs with different verbose level
* [c0008 log - verbose level v](../../logs/c0008_v)
* [c0008 log - verbose level vv](../../logs/c0008_vv)
* [c0008 log - verbose level vvv](../../logs/c0008_vvvv)
* [c0008 log - verbose level vvvv](../../logs/c0008_vvvv)
* [c0008 log - verbose level vvvvv](../../logs/c0008_vvvvv)

##### Raw logs with different verbose level
* [c0008 raw log - verbose level v](../../reflogs/c0008_v.log)
* [c0008 raw log - verbose level vv](../../reflogs/c0008_vv.log)
* [c0008 raw log - verbose level vvv](../../reflogs/c0008_vvv.log)

* [c0008 raw log - verbose level vvvvv](../../reflogs/c0008_vvvvv.log)







### Demo result


This demo will have an expected result of
```
overall final exec vars:

(*core.Cache)({
  "a": "dev-a",
  "b": "non-prod-b",
  "c": "dev-c",
  "d": "global-d"
})
```
