##### Showcase how to use readFile and writeFile cmd


### my story text file reference






```
      Once when I was six years old I saw a magnificent picture in a book, called True Stories from Nature, about the primeval forest. It was a picture of a boa constrictor in the act of swallowing an animal. Here is a copy of the drawing.
    
        boa constrictor swallowing an animal
      In the book it said: "Boa constrictors swallow their prey whole, without chewing it. After that they are not able to move, and they sleep through the six months that they need for digestion."
    
      I pondered deeply, then, over the adventures of the jungle. And after some work with a colored pencil I succeeded in making my first drawing. My Drawing Number One. It looked something like this:
    
        Drawing Number One
        I showed my masterpiece to the grown-ups, and asked them whether the drawing frightened them.
    
      But they answered: "Frighten? Why should any one be frightened by a hat?"
    
      My drawing was not a picture of a hat. It was a picture of a boa constrictor digesting an elephant. But since the grown-ups were not able to understand it, I made another drawing: I drew the inside of a boa constrictor, so that the grown-ups could see it clearly. They always need to have things explained. My Drawing Number Two looked like this:w
