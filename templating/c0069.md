##### Showcase how to use external tool, eg shell script to tempate content


### template dynamic content


Note that the content of school_address is templated from defined global runtime var

```
address:
  suburb:
    name: {{.student.address.suburb.name}}
    postcode: 2000
    CBD: yes
  school: {{.student.address.school}}

```

The rendered content is dumped to a file and shown afterwards











### Demo

##### Main task yaml file
```
