##### Showcase how to use external tool, eg shell script to tempate content


### template dynamic content


Note that the content of school_address is templated from defined global runtime var

```
address:
  suburb:
    name: {{.student.address.suburb.name}}
    postcode: 2000
    CBD: yes
  school: {{.student.address.school}}

```

The rendered content is dumped to a file and shown afterwards











### Demo

##### Main task yaml file
```
    vars:
      student:
        name: Tom
        gender: Male
        address:
          suburb:
            name: sydney
            postcode: 2000
            CBD: yes
          school: Sydney Grammar
    dvars:
    - name: school_address
      ref: d0069.yml
    tasks:
    - name: task
      task:
      - func: shell
        do:
        - echo """school address {{.school_address}}"""
