##### This demos a design pattern using call and callee task without local vars

The caller's varss should always take priority than the the callee's vars, if callee has already got same local vars defined, they will be overrided and used as default values


### Applications


The possible application of this pattern is to  call different implmentation task depending on certain condition, For example,

1. you could conditionally deploy an application to AWS, Azure or K8s depending on criteria

2. you could provistion backend storage solution using EBS, EFS











### Demo

##### Main task yaml file
```
    vars:
      school: sydney grammar
    tasks:
    - name: task
      task:
      - func: call
        desc: call function with different vars
        vars:
          studentname: Tom
          school: sydney grammar
          gender: male
        do:
        - function
    - name: function
      desc: |
        as a design pattern, this is a function task
        it's better to not to use any local vars, in this
        way, the vars are passed in from caller call so
        that this function could be used by multiple ref tasks
      task:
      - func: shell
        desc: show school and student info
        do:
        - echo "studentname -> {{.studentname}} | gender -> {{.gender}}"
        - echo "school -> {{.school}}"
    
```
